# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices based on features like size, number of rooms, and location using a simple Linear Regression model.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a house given specific attributes. This can help in property evaluation and market analysis.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm

- **Linear Regression** from `scikit-learn`

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Features used:
  - `LotArea`: Total area
  - `OverallQual`: Quality rating
  - `YearBuilt`: Year of construction
  - `TotalBsmtSF`: Basement area
  - `GrLivArea`: Above ground living area
  - `FullBath`, `BedroomAbvGr`, etc.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **matplotlib / seaborn** (for visualization)
